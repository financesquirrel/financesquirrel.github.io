Hey there! Welcome! My name is Chris and I am your neighborly squirrel 🐿️ who has super powers and can write about personal finance!

“Okay sure, squirrel …“

Fine. The reality is that I’m just a regular guy who went to school, got good grades, and has a job. Happy now?

I’ve been working in corporate America for over 15 years and I’ve been able to save a significant portion of my earnings while living well below my means. Having accumulated cash which I have not invested wisely is one of the main reasons to start this blog and share my experiences as I invest and learn.

A bit more about me. I’m in my 30’s. I work as a software engineer. I’m a family man and I have a newborn whom I would like to spend more time with. This is the other main motivation behind this endeavor to improve my financial literacy and reach F.I.R.E. (Financial Independence Retire Early). If you’re curious to learn more about where I come from and where I’m going, my first blog post serves as a good supplemental “About me” page.

I hope that the community would help keep me honest and we can learn and build wealth together. Feel free to follow me on Twitter at @FinanceSquirre1 and subscribe to the RSS feed here. Cheers!
