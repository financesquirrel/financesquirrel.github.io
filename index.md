Hi! I'm Chris, a.k.a. Finance Squirrel 🐿️. I started this blog in 2021 out of the desire to improve my financial literacy and reach FIRE in five years. Here I share my experiences as I learn about investing and building wealth. Hopefully you can find some of this useful as you navigate your own path to financial independence. Cheers!
